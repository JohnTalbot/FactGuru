primary purpose: 

  Leveraging the true power of artificial intelligence (AI) in virtual reality (VR) educational games.
  AI is used by the Ontologist to develop both the educational content and the virtual environment.
  The resulting Ontology is then used by the game programmer to vastly simplify game design and development.

secondary purpose:
  1. To familiarize the user with focus fusion technology and the promise it holds for solving all our energy problems.
  2. To teach the scientific method via an example in astrophysics : The thesis that belief is stronger than reason
     is exemplified using the Laser Star Theory, a Nobel Prize-winning model of quasars.

stealth learning:
  educational materials presented non-traditionally (e.g. gradually) so that the user does not
  immediately recognized they are being taught. The user gradually uncovers portions of the Ontology
  as they progress in the game via the game 'mechanics'. Ultimately the user learns to appreciate the
  benefits of AI and virtual reality in their educational development.

virtual reality:
  computer generated 3D environment, artifacts and computer mediated interactions with user

artificial intelligence:
  Knowledge represented as an Ontology.
  Ontology semantically linked to virtual reality such that first order logic mediates both user and programmer interactions with environment and artifacts.
  Knowledge base augmented with pedagogical learning threads (pedagogical markup knowledge about knowledge, a kind of metadata)
  (i.e. users can create their own threads depending on their interests)
  Users and programmers have identical capabilities except for publishing and internet sharing
  Linguistic minimalism.

implementation:
  1. C++ with full round trip UML and marked up with Unreal macros
  2. Ontology

design details:
  Systems engineering is used to model scenarios, environments, artifacts and processes.
  User interactions with environment, artifacts and processes is the basis for the game.

design goal:
  - PROBLEM: Create a separation of concerns between the low level C++ and the knowledge base.
  - SOLUTION: Use the Ontology to simultaneously describe both the knowledge and the game implementation details.
      1. Users can browse the knowledge independently of game implementation details
      2. Programmers enter knowledge into the Ontology instead of C++ programming
         (a) add to the world by creating geometrical content in UDK, Blender or Maya
         (b) associate geometrical content with physics knowledge in the Ontology
         (c) associate geometrical content with game implementation details in the Ontology

Ontology-based educational game: 

  Physical model maps directly to the conceptual model. Various physical phenomena share
  a common subset of fundamental physical behaviors this leads to the following problem: 

  PROBLEM
  (1) Fact: In standard educational materials each document must duplicate this common set. 
      Consequence: Students waste time sifting though this re-introduced material for new knowledge.
  
  (2) Fact: Differing fields of study have different terminology for common topics.
      Consequence: Students are confused by the myriad of synonyms as they study different fields. 
      
  (3) Fact: Documents refer to other documents.
      Consequence: Students waste time searching and aquiring these linked documents. 
        Students waste money aquiring documents that are paywalled or only available
        at bookstores.
        
  (4) Fact: Relationships between concepts are not obvious, they are scattered within the documents.
      Consequence: Student must digest all the materials before these relationships emerge. 
  
  SOLUTION:  
  (1) The Ontology facilitates the sharing of this commonality by having a central location
      for the storage of this knowledge. Subject, topic or fact in the Ontology can have
      an associated personalized boolean 'visited' value (similar to alternate link color of visited web pages).  
      In addition, each subject, topic or fact can store the user's personalized proficiency
      level indicating their level of mastery in the associated subject matter.
      
  (2) Unified terminology; Preferred terms are chosen and synonyms are avoided.
  
  (3) The need for external reference is dramatically reduced since most of the required
      knowlegde is contained in the Ontology therefore most reference links are internal.

  (4) Graphs make the relationships between concepts immediately obvious.

====== Conceptual Model ==========

The physical models such as environment, artifact or process are mapped to conceptual models contained in a knowledge base (Ontology)

Knowledge base structure :

- Each concept or topic has :
  - Definition
  - Facts
  - Relationships with other concepts or topics

- Each concept, topic or fact has :
  - Topic(s) under which they are classified
  - Level-of-detail
      This value represents succesively more detailed exposition, the inverted pyramid technique used by reporters
      Purpose:
         1 - A thresold to reduce clutter when browsing
         2 - Optionality value so users can select an upper bound on the level-of-detail
         3 - The threshold can be set automatically based on user age, educational backgroud or learning progression rate (as they 'level-up') 

- Presentation and navigation methods :
    Each concept, topic or fact can have multiple level-of-detail values associated with each
    presentation method below :

  - a select set of important facts and inherited facts
  - a select set of super-concepts and sub-concepts as links
  - a select set of parts and part-of facts
  - top level concepts first and progressively deeper in kinds and parts 
  - Instances first and and progressively more general super concepts
  - thread or tutorial : pedagogical sequence of topics, concepts or facts
  - ?? limit exposition by automatically assigning a lower level-of-detail value to each succesive link traversed (indirection threshold)
  - topic hierarchy
  - parts hierarchy
  - the sun graph display mode

    Implementation of secondary purposes:

---------------------------------------------------

There is a beneficial synergy between phenomena in nature and in experiment:
  (a) NATURE: observation of nature
       - like an uncontrolled experiment with a set of parameters. Some parameters are known some unkown.
  (b) EXPERIMENT: experiments in laboratories
       - many parameters can be chosen for each experimental run
       - can model or reproduce a naturally occuring phenomena

The phenomena to be studied are analyzed into a hierachy of fundamental physical behaviors
each associated with experimental apparatus. The Ontology Level-of-detail value
for each experiment contributes to the smooth and gradual progression of learning.
